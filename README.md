## About the project
Submission for the https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/managing-fire-increasing-community-based-fire-management-opportunities/


In response to the ongoing global trend of increasing temperatures leading to a higher frequency of wildfires, the region of Sonora, Mexico, has emerged as one of the top ten areas within Mexico grappling with substantial wildfire-related challenges. Due to this critical situation, we are developing a computer program designed to predict the path of wildfires effectively. This program operates as an intelligent predictive tool and harnesses the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks, a well-established and highly effective method for such predictive tasks.



Recognizing that reliable internet or cellular connectivity may be limited, particularly in remote areas, we are incorporating a specialized alert system that functions independently of the internet. This system relies on LoRaWAN technology, which facilitates long-distance alert transmission without the need for internet connectivity.

Furthermore, our project includes the creation of a website featuring a 3D map displaying the current wildfire location and its potential trajectory. This map also indicates the areas where alerts have been dispatched. This resource serves as a valuable decision-making tool for various stakeholders, including firefighters, local authorities, and the general public seeking up-to-date information.

Our objective is to employ advanced computer tools and specialized alert systems to notify individuals when an impending fire is approaching their location, particularly in remote and challenging-to-access areas.

In addition to these high-tech solutions, it's important to note that some communities in Sonora do not rely on any formal predictive systems for wildfires. Consequently, our approach also includes the development of analytical tools that utilize locally available objects and knowledge to forecast fire risks. This way, we can offer a more inclusive solution that caters to the diverse needs of the region. Adding to the previous context, an ecologist from the state of Sonora who specializes in wildfires, has stated: 

> "We do not use any plataform that predicts the trajectory of the fires; everything we do is based purely on expert judgment."
> Juan Mario Cirett Gálan

  </a>
</p>




This underscores the need for our project to also consider and incorporate traditional and expert-based methods of wildfire prediction. This will ensure that our advanced tools and specialized alert systems are complemented by the wealth of existing local knowledge, offering a more comprehensive and adaptable solution for wildfire prediction and management in Sonora. We are aiming to exapnd into the whole world not only in Sonora.


## Introduction
The Wildfire Prediction and Alert System is a sophisticated initiative developed in response to the escalating number of forest fires, exacerbated by increased global temperatures—a situation largely attributed to human activities. This advanced system utilizes machine learning to predict wildfire spread and deliver critical alerts to populations in high-risk areas, particularly focusing on the state of Sonora, Mexico, which ranks among the nation's most wildfire-prone regions.

## Background
The state of Sonora, confronted with the harsh realities of climate change, witnesses a high frequency of forest fires, underscoring the need for robust predictive models. This project presents a dual-model approach for predicting wildfire trajectories: one harnessing the predictive power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the other employing a Random Forest algorithm that uses decision trees for forecast generation. These technologies work in tandem to produce highly accurate wildfire spread estimations, enabling the issuance of timely alerts to at-risk populations.

Recognizing the infrastructural challenges faced by remote communities—particularly those with limited access to internet and power—we have integrated a LoRaWAN-based alert system. This innovation is pivotal in reaching the most isolated and vulnerable areas, ensuring that critical alerts are disseminated without fail in regions severely affected by wildfires.

Complementing our alert system is a web interface designed for researchers, firefighting squads, and other stakeholders, enabling them to conduct a thorough analysis of the predictive data. This tool is crucial for strategic planning and intervention, providing an interactive platform for monitoring fire progression and response efficacy.

## Instructions to Run Models  


### How to run [Convolutional Neural Network + LSTM Model](https://github.com/jbric16/FlameForecast_Project/tree/main/deep_learning)

1. The notebook is executable on Google Colab, a cloud computing platform that offers a free Jupyter Notebooks environment. No additional configuration is needed for most cases, as Google Colab comes pre-installed with many data science and machine learning libraries.
2. [DataSets](https://github.com/jbric16/FlameForecast_Project/tree/main/deep_learning/Datasets) for the notebook to work correctly, you only need to load two specific data sets. You can do this using Google Colab's file import capabilities or upload them from Google Drive if they are stored there.



#### Area to be analyzed 

Popular Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and numpy are used for data analysis and visualization. Additionally, the machine learning model implements convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM). The notebook starts by importing these libraries and loading the data set from a CSV file. The data is then binned into 6-hour time intervals to facilitate subsequent analysis.

<p align="center">Above: All the wildfires in the zone of Nogales, Sonora from 2016 to 2023 </p>



The notebook is designed to predict the path of fires in a specific area of ​​Nogales, Sonora, covering a sampling area of ​​64 km x 64 km, as you can see in figure 1. The data, which ranges from 2016 to 2023, comes from the FIRMS system (Fire Information for Resource Management System).

  <img src="images/NogalesWildfire.jpg" alt="Texto Alternativo" width="600"/>
</p>

#### Data quality


In the study of fires and climate conditions, certain variables show considerable variation, making them potentially important factors to consider. For instance, 'Brightness' and 'FRP (Fire Radiative Power)' in the fire dataset, along with 'Apparent Temperature', 'Heat Index', and 'Humidity' in the climate dataset, exhibit a wide range of values, suggesting they could be good indicators of fire intensity and atmospheric conditions, respectively. Conversely, variables like 'Scan' and 'Track' in the fire dataset, as well as 'Precipitation' in the climate dataset, display less variation, possibly indicating their limited utility in differentiating fires or assessing their likelihood. Meanwhile, variables such as 'Confidence' and 'Temperature' in the fire data, along with 'Wind Speed' and 'Wind Direction' in the climate data, also show notable variation, hinting at their relevance in evaluating the confidence level in fire detection and understanding fire spread.

<p align="center"><img src="images/IMAGENESCOMPLETAS.png" alt="Texto Alternativo" width="1000"/></p>


### Dataset
For deep learning model training, the dataset is a CSV file. The CSV are split approximately into 2 subsets for model training (80%) and validation (20%). We use the following feature as input to train the model:

- Fire

The target output depends on how the data has been entered, if each matrix in the sequence represents one day of data, then the prediction would be for the next day based on the previous 4 days.



#### Model training

- The model, which is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks, was trained using the Adam optimization algorithm. The binary cross-entropy loss function was minimized over 20 epochs with a batch size of 5. Additionally, techniques such as early stopping and learning rate reduction were implemented to improve training efficiency.

- The input variables are sequences of 5 64x64 grayscale images. These images represent geospatial and temporal data and are processed by the Convolutional and LSTM layers of the model. The images were normalized and the data set was split into 80% for training and 20% for validation.

- The binary cross entropy loss function was optimized during training. This function is typically used in binary classification problems and is particularly suitable for this Convolutional and LSTM model.

- The model makes predictions for a period of 5 time steps. The temporal interpretation of these steps depends on how the data was entered. For example, if each array in the sequence represents one day of data, then the prediction would be for the next day based on the previous 4 days.

- To evaluate the performance of the Convolutional and LSTM model, precision and completeness (recall) metrics were used on the validation set, as well as "No-fire Precision" and "No-Fire Recall" to evaluate the model's ability to correctly predict non-fire areas.

- The binary cross-entropy loss function was used, which is consistent with the binary classification nature of the problem and the Convolutional and LSTM design of the model.
 
 - Once the Convolutional and LSTM model was trained, predictions were generated for the validation set. Precision and completeness metrics were calculated to evaluate its performance. The resulting values ​​were a precision of 82.35% and a completeness of 74.14%.




The model pays special attention to the most recent information, as evidenced by the relationship between "Original Time 4" and "Actual Prediction 5." This feature is essential in situations where the most recent data is the most relevant for making predictions. The model's prediction, as seen in "Actual Prediction 5", appears to filter out and smooth out some of the noise present in the original images. This can be useful in identifying areas of primary interest and eliminating potential false alarms.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/Prediction.png" alt="Texto Alternativo" width="800"/>
  </a>
</p>

#### Model evaluation

The validation data subset is utilized to assess the ConvLSTM model's performance on data. This allows us to compare the results with other models and check if the model is doign corrdtc. Below are the performance metrics.

| Metric        | Fire Precision | Fire Recall | No-Fire Precision | No-Fire Recall |
|---------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| ConvLSTM      | 0.92          | 0.75       | 0.99              | 0.99           |





#### Future Work

- AutoML Pipelines – Deploy AutoML pipelines to improve efficiency in model architecture and hyperparameter testing.

- Add more data: Expand the data set to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model.

1. [Download data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fantineh/next-day-wildfire-spread) This dataset is a comprehensive, multivariate compilation of historical wildfires in the United States over nearly a decade. It merges two-dimensional fire data with a rich set of explanatory variables like topography, weather, and vegetation, making it an ideal resource for machine learning applications. It comprises 18,445 samples, each representing a 64 km x 64 km region where a fire occurred. The dataset includes 'fire' vs. 'no fire' labels, with an extra category for uncertain labels. To study fire propagation, it contains both the previous day's fire mask and the current day's fire mask. Using Google Earth Engine, data from various sources are collated and layered with relevant variables for wildfire prediction, including elevation, temperature, humidity, and more. This dataset is invaluable for developing wildfire propagation models based on remote sensing data with a one-day lead time.

### Temporal Analysis and Visualization of NDVI in Nogales with Google Earth Engine and Folium

The notebook provided includes a geospatial analysis focused on a specific Area of Interest (AOI). The geographic location used for the analysis is Nogales, a city located on the border between Mexico and the United States. This interpretation is based on the geographic coordinates provided in the code, which define the AOI polygon.

The Area of Interest is defined as a polygon using a specific set of coordinates. These coordinates delimit an area that is used to extract and analyze relevant geospatial data, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI is a key indicator in remote sensing to evaluate vegetation and its health.

This analysis could be used for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, and the study of local ecosystems. By applying tools such as Google Earth Engine and Folium, the code makes it easy to visualize and analyze trends in vegetation and other geospatial aspects of the Nogales region over time.

## LoRa Communication

<p align="center">

</p>

First, let's clarify the distinction between LoRa and LoRaWAN:

LoRa is a wireless modulation technique derived from Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technology, which encodes information into radio waves.
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Screenshot 2023-10-19 at 4.52.02.png" alt="Image Alt Text">
</p>

LoRaWAN, on the other hand, is a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer built on top of LoRa. It serves as a network architecture that enables interconnection, bidirectional communication, and scalability.

When we combine these two technologies, we create a communication system that operates without the need for an internet connection. LoRa gateways and end devices make this possible. Within the gateway's range, a bidirectional message can be transmitted via LoRa radio waves. Subsequently, the gateway operates through LoRaWAN to facilitate the transmission or reception of information to and from the network and application server.

The LoRa architecture seamlessly enables communication with our end node, which functions as an alert receiver equipped with an Arduino, operating within the 863-923 MHz frequency range. Within this operational framework, our application server efficiently manages the processing of HTTP requests generated by our model, directing them to the network server. The LoRaWAN network server establishes a communication channel with a LoRa gateway. This gateway exclusively employs LoRa RF radio waves, utilizing chirp pulses, and plays a pivotal role in transmitting messages.

To further enhance our non-Internet communication capabilities, we've implemented a network of three LoRa Gateways, effectively serving as signal repeaters. These gateways collaborate to extend the reach of Node End devices, acting as receivers, allowing them to transmit messages across distances of up to 45 kilometers without reliance on an internet connection, solely harnessing the capabilities of LoRa RF technology.
